🕊️ Readers' Pigeons (Ընթերցողի Աղավնիները)

Readers' Pigeons is a small interactive storytelling project written entirely in C, inspired by Vahan Totovents’ novella “Aghavniner” (The Pigeons). The idea is simple: you read parts of the original story, then make choices that shape what happens next.

It’s a mix of classic literature and interactive fiction — all running in your terminal.
